I'm going to try using https://github.com/SvarDOS/edrdos to make a DOS boot
image that I can use for many purposes from scratch. This is also an attempt
to satisfy my uncle's desire for me to use GitHub more, since I don't really
have much in the way of my own Git server right now.

Anything that wasn't taken from third-party sources can be freely used, all
of the serious stuff I'm gonna copyright somehow will be outside this
